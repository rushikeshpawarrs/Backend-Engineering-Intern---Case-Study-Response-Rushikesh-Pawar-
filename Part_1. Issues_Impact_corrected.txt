Issues:
1. No Proper data validation
2. SKU uniqueness is not checked before creating any new product
3. Commit() calls should be used once only, it is not efficient to use twice it breaks the atomicity
4. DB interaction should be put between a try catch block 

Impact:
1. With no proper data validation, the application can crach with a TypeError.
2. By not checking the SKU, duplicate products with the same SKU can be created in the DB, it can give false inventory counts
3. It simply can break the ACID properties that should be followed by DB, its a good practice to Commit only when a full transaction is completed
4. Try catch block keeps our app in a reliable state even if app generates error

Correct Code:

@app.route('/api/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Create product
    product = Product(
        name=data.get('name'),
        sku=data.get('sku'),
        price=data.get('price')
    )
    db.session.add(product)
    db.session.flush()   # get product.id before commit

    # Create inventory
    inventory = Inventory(
        product_id=product.id,
        warehouse_id=data.get('warehouse_id'),
        quantity=data.get('initial_quantity', 0)  # default 0 if not given
    )
    db.session.add(inventory)

    # Commit once
    db.session.commit()
    #jsonify should always be a good practive, to avoid any error
    return jsonify({"message": "Product created", "product_id": product.id})
